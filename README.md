**Built with Modern Technology Stack**

This web-based inventory management system is built using the following technologies:

- **Front-End:**
  - HTML: Provides the core structure and content of the web application.
  - CSS: Styles the user interface for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
  - JavaScript: Enables interactivity and dynamic behavior within the front-end.
- **Back-End:**
  - PHP: Handles server-side scripting, interacts with the database, and generates dynamic web pages.
  - MySQL: The relational database management system that stores and manages inventory and sales data.

**Security and Error Handling**

This application prioritizes data security and user experience by implementing:

- **Multiple Layers of Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms ensure the system gracefully handles unexpected situations and provides informative messages to users.
- **Security Checking:** Measures are in place to safeguard against potential security vulnerabilities, protecting user data and system integrity.
